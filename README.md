# Movie_Recommendation_system

The goal of this project is to develop a content-based recommendation engine for movies and TV shows on Netflix where I will compare two different methods:

1.Using cast, director, country, rating and genres as features.
2.Using the words in the movie/TV show descriptions as features.

# Conclusion
Taking the cast, director, country, rating and genres as features rather than the descriptions was definitely the better option. Some of the recommendations by descriptions are good such as the 'Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast' recommendation for 'Hook' and the 'Extracurricular' recommendation for '13 Reasons Why', but most of them are from completely different genres with very little in common besides a few key words.
