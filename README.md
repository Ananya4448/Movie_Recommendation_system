# Movie_Recommendation_system

The goal of this project is to develop a content-based recommendation engine for movies and TV shows on Netflix where I will compare two different methods:

1.Using cast, director, country, rating and genres as features.
2.Using the words in the movie/TV show descriptions as features.
